About ====
Our project is a robot that can sort objects by color. It will demonstrate this by picking the objects up with a claw and moving them into designated 
areas of an arena based on their color.

We are hoping to learn about computer vision, pathing/navigation, and hardware integration through this project. 

We think this project should be evaluated primarily based on whether or not it can successfully preform the task of sorting object without error, and
secondly based on how efficiently and smoothly it preforms this task.
