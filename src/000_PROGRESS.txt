This tells us what we are working on. 
TODO =========================
Connect the parts. Precision grab the objects? 
Build a wooden staging object for the cans? 


EXISTING PROGRESS ===================
Week#1 J ====
Currently, I've added a bunch of extra useful code to the repo. 
However, I'm really only working on main.py. 

The launch file will launch main.py, key_publisher.py for manual control, and rqt_image_view
Week #2 ====
J : created launch file. 


Week #4 ====
Isaac has the image and centroid done. 
Jeremy: 
fsm_demo3.py shows the basic state diagram of the project. I'd like to make this into state_implementer
soon. 


From here we can see if we can get diff parts of the project to deliver cmd_vel controls to the robot.
During Goto_loading, we can use fidu. 
During Cv_find,  we can use cv and centroid.
